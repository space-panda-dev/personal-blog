It's pretty empty in here!

My intention is to fill this page with interesting portfolio projects. I am mainly a backend engineer these days, but I'd like to keep my frontend/ui skills sharp (if they were ever sharp to begin with). Also I've found myself drawn back to programming as a hobby for the first time in almost a decade. Let's see where that wind takes us ^_^_
