Hello internet!
I am a backend engineer who's dipping my feet back into frontend. I also play many instruments, enjoy strategy games, and host a [tiny desk clone](https://www.youtube.com/@IndieShowcaselkld).

This site is essentially my portfolio, for both work and play. Follow my RSS feed if you enjoy reading the ramblings of a deadhead who's still using emacs.
